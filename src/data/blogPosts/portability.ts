  title: "Portability of Estate Tax Exemptions for Married Couples",
  introduction: "Estate planning can be a daunting process, but for married couples, the concept of portability offers a powerful tool to maximize tax efficiency. Portability allows a surviving spouse to \"inherit\" their deceased spouse's unused federal estate tax exemption, effectively doubling the amount that can be passed to heirs tax-free. Understanding how portability works and taking the proper steps to implement it can save families millions in taxes.",
