  title: "Probate Basics: A Step-by-Step Guide to the Court Process",
  introduction: "Probate is a legal process that oversees the distribution of a deceased person's estate. While it ensures assets are transferred according to the will or state laws, it can often be a lengthy and complicated process. Understanding probate's steps and potential challenges can help families navigate this process more smoothly.",

    {
      title: "What Is Probate?",
      content: "Probate is the court-supervised process of validating a will, paying debts, and distributing assets to beneficiaries. If no will exists, the estate is distributed according to state intestacy laws. The process ensures the deceased's wishes are followed while protecting creditors and resolving disputes.\n\n" +
        "Probate applies to assets solely owned by the deceased. Certain assets, like joint accounts or those with named beneficiaries (e.g., life insurance policies), bypass probate entirely."

      title: "Step 1: Filing a Petition to Open Probate",
      content: "The process begins with filing a petition in probate court. The executor (named in the will) or an administrator (appointed by the court) submits the petition, along with:\n\n" +
        "• The death certificate\n" +
        "• The original will (if applicable)\n\n" +
        "The court reviews the will and confirms its validity. If no will exists, the court appoints an administrator, typically a close family member. Once approved, the executor or administrator gains legal authority to manage the estate."

    {
      title: "Step 2: Notifying Beneficiaries and Creditors",
      content: "Once probate is opened, the executor must notify all interested parties, including beneficiaries and creditors. Notifications are typically sent via mail and published in local newspapers to alert potential creditors.\n\n" +
        "Creditors are given a deadline to file claims against the estate. This ensures that any outstanding debts are addressed before assets are distributed."

    {
      title: "Step 3: Inventorying the Estate",
      content: "The executor compiles a detailed inventory of the deceased's assets, including:\n\n" +
        "• Real estate\n" +
        "• Bank accounts\n" +
        "• Investments (e.g., stocks and bonds)\n" +
        "• Personal property (e.g., vehicles, jewelry, collectibles)\n\n" +
        "Each asset is appraised to determine its value. This inventory provides the court and beneficiaries with a clear picture of the estate's total worth."
    },
    {
      title: "Step 4: Paying Debts and Taxes",
      content: "Before beneficiaries receive their inheritances, the executor must settle the deceased's debts, including:\n\n" +
        "• Outstanding bills (e.g., medical, utility)\n" +
        "• Credit card balances\n" +
        "• Loans and mortgages\n\n" +
        "The executor is also responsible for filing the deceased's final income tax return and paying any estate taxes. This step is crucial, as failing to address these obligations can delay distributions or lead to legal complications."
