      title: "Understanding Special Needs Trusts",
      content: "A Special Needs Trust (sometimes called a Supplemental Needs Trust) is designed to enhance the quality of life for individuals with disabilities while preserving their eligibility for public benefits like Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income (SSI).\n\nUnlike direct gifts or inheritances, which can disqualify someone from receiving government assistance, assets held in a properly structured SNT don't count toward benefit eligibility limits. This allows the trust to provide supplemental support while maintaining access to essential healthcare coverage and monthly disability benefits."

Third-Party SNT:\n• Created and funded by someone other than the beneficiary\n• No Medicaid payback required\n• Greater flexibility in distribution of remaining assets\n\n3. Pooled Trust:\n• Managed by nonprofit organizations\n• Combines assets from multiple beneficiaries\n• Suitable for smaller estates\n• May be more cost-effective"
